    "Parallel|In parallel the batteries act like they were only one, by giving the same voltage, but they have increased capacity and peak current. Be aware while building one of this kind of battery pack that voltage between each cell need to be the same, otherwise you risk of destroying your cells.",
    "Series|In series the battery sum their voltage, while keeping the capacity the same as the original single cell. If you are building this kind of battery pack,if rechargeable you must include a BMS(Battery Management System) to balance charging, otherwise you migth destroy your cell(s) (especialy if lithium based)."
